# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

You got that couch money yet?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to make a website that tracks my financial data and gives me a few graphs to show my progress towards a set goal. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to use PySimpleGUI and create a page which tracks my saving/spending (go back to 6months of data) and gives me a progress report. 
The site will analyze my income, bills(water, PECO, PWG, Insurance, internet, ADT), gas, grocery, medical expenses, cell phone, and MISC spending.
I would like the project to help me determine when I have saved enough to buy a specific couch from LoveSac (slightly over 5,000.00 USD). 
The end goal will be date I have saved (slightly more than 5,000.00 USD) and the program should tell me how much I was able to save each month.
which will then be translated to a graph which shows my progress.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to make sure I set up the GUI and have at least the data and the progress report. I think the graphs will be the last thing I do.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to have the graphs and have the final window look complete and finished. Add fun colors and maybe a  picture of the couch.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have all may data with appropriate equations and my GUI window set up and looking like a competent person made it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to undertand and use PySimpleGUI, pandas, and matplotlib.
